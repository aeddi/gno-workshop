This workshop is designed to help you master the **Gno** programming language through **a series of hands-on exercises**.

Gno combines the simplicity of **Go with blockchain capabilities**, offering a unique platform for building **decentralized applications** with familiar syntax and powerful features.

You're currently viewing this content through **Gnoweb - the web interface** for the Gno blockchain. What you're seeing is not a static website, but rather the web representation of a Realm (smart contract) **dynamically rendered by a Gnoland node**.

Whether you're new to blockchain development or transitioning from Go, these tutorials will guide you through Gno's core concepts, from basic syntax to advanced Realm development.

## Getting Started

To begin your journey with Gno, you first need to **set up your environment**. Follow the steps listed on our [dedicated repo](` + setupRepo + `).

Once your environment is set up, review the list of [exercises](/r/workshop/home#exercises) below and follow the instructions provided. **We recommend progressing sequentially**, as each exercise builds on previous concepts and is designed to help you understand various aspects of the Gno programming language.

For more in-depth information, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.gno.land).
